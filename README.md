# SD_sort_directory
Reorder files of a directory as ascending order in directory structure.

This is mainly used to prepare SD card or USB memory for picture player or music player which are not aware about filename but simply play the order of directory structure.

This also gather all dot-started files into .t directory because Mac file system copies resource bundle into SD-card but normaly it should be ignored.
